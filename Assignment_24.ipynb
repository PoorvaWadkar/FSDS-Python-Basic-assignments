    "1.What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are ways to define functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "def statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA def statement is used to define a regular, named function. It starts with the def keyword followed by the function name, a set of parentheses for parameters, a colon, and then the function body indented below. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tdef statement has a proper name that can be used to call the function from anywhere in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt allows to define complex functions with multiple statements, loops, conditionals, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt can have docstrings to provide detailed documentation for the function's purpose, parameters, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA lambda expression is a compact way to define small, anonymous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt uses the lambda keyword followed by parameters (without parentheses), a colon, and the expression to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA lambda expression creates an anonymous function. While we can assign the lambda expression to a variable it doesn't have a formal name. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLambda expressions are meant for simple, one-liner functions. They are best suited for cases where a quick, concise function is needed, especially as an argument to higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLambdas are limited in terms of adding comments  which can affect code readability especially for more complex operations.\n"

    "2.What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLambda expressions are very compact and allow you to define functions in a single line of code. This can lead to more readable and expressive code, especially when the function logic is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLambda expressions create anonymous functions, which means you don't need to provide a formal name for functions that are only used in a specific context or for a short duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhen used appropriately, lambda expressions can improve code readability by keeping the function logic close to its usage, especially when used as arguments in higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tyou can pass them around like any other value. This facilitates the creation of more flexible and modular code.\n"

    "•\tA function should have a clear and single purpose. It should ideally perform one task or solve one problem. This makes functions easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFunctions should have a meaningful and descriptive names that convey their purpose and functionality. \n",

    "•\tHide implementation details and expose only necessary information through function parameters and return values. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tKeep the number of parameters reasonable. Too many parameters can make a function harder to use and understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFunctions should be designed to work with local data rather than relying heavily on global variables. This improves encapsulation and makes the function more self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tProvide clear and concise documentation for your functions. Use docstrings to describe the purpose, parameters, and return values of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\t Use exceptions or error codes to indicate problems, and provide informative error messages that aid in debugging.\n"

    "7.Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tReturn Values: Functions often use return values to communicate results back to the caller. A return value is the data or value that a function produces and hands back to the code that called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tModifying Mutable Objects: Functions can modify mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) that are passed to them as arguments. While this doesn't involve a traditional return value, it allows the function to change the state of an object in a way that's visible to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tGlobal Variables: While not always recommended due to potential issues with code organization and maintainability, functions can communicate results by modifying global variables. Global variables are accessible to all functions in a module, so changes made by one function are visible to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPrint Statements: Although not the most common way to communicate results, functions can print information directly to the console using print() statements. This approach is often used for debugging purposes or for providing visual feedback during the execution of a program.\n"
